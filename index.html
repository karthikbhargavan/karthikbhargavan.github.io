<p class="note" id="plate-note">
  From the outside you see four panels made of gestural strokes of seeming gold, when you open the central panels, inside there is a shelf where you might stack clean plates. This glistening façade hides a mystery; a taboo question: when those dishes are dirty, whose job will it be to wash them?  If you approach from the back, the question is answered by brawling sculptures, slightly hidden behind the fixed, lateral front panels. A broken bronze woman prepares to fling a plate at a broken bronze man who appears to run from her while carrying plates on his head. Only now do you see in the golden façade, that the arc of those flying plates, as if frozen in time, is reflected in the brush strokes of the door and the violent splashes and swirls inscribed into the other bronze surfaces.
  <br/> <br/>
  I created this piece using processes that I have been developing with hot wax painting and direct wax building which I then carefully transform into bronze (if this stage fails there is no mold or model to go back to). Then I put together these pieces in the metal shop.  For the façade I invented a technique to chemically oxidize silver leaf into a myriad of yellows and oranges.

6 piece modular coffee table, bronze, H 40-50 L 150  W 138 cm, unique.
</p>
<p class="note" id="oceans-note">
  <i>Oceans of Notions</i> is made up of 6 small bronze tables. When arranged together they make up a large coffee table with 12 surface panels floating at varying heights, Each surface panel has irregular edges and deep swirling trenches  running through it like the mark left by flowing water in a riverbed.
The surface panels rest on open motif bronze side panels that were made by painting, brushing and building directly in hot wax. Each of the six modules has a different organisation of these supporting side panels, with a total of 22 side panels in all, casting intertwining shadows of imaginary language on the floor below the table. The title for this piece is adapted from the name of a character in Salman Rushdie's "Haroun and the Sea of Stories". 
<br/><br/>
 The table’s surface is a matte casein paint (thank you Vincent Dubourg) that I hand-tinted with pure pigment. After regrinding the top layer of paint off the surface I applied a cold metal patina and wax to protect the exposed part of the metal surface from oxidizing. It is a strong, easily washable surface.

Sometimes I imagine to myself that if I were a man my work would be more visible to others. This is wrong, of course, because the fact that I am free to make my work is everything, really, and to hold the belief that I can see clearly and understand the perception of others is pure fantasy. Still, such projections can begin to feel very real and dominate our daily experiences of one another, and of what we make, do and say.  <i>Les Lumières</i>  which translates in English as <i>The Luminaries</i>, is made up of four unique bronze sculptures lit from within. This work lays bare my apprehensions about working in an art world that is still dominated by male intellectuals, artists, and collectors. To make the one-of-a-kind sculptures, I started with four studies I had made of different male models over the years, marrying the legs and torsos of the original sculptures to a variety of light filtering abstract structures built in direct wax. For the finish, I explored new ways of creating a patina with chemical vapours that resulted in this unusual blue/grey/black color and texture.

<i>Parchemins</i> is a portrait of a table in which a paper-thin surface rectangle of sculpted bronze with an irregular edge is balanced in equilibrium on four rolled bronze legs. The sculpted tabletop is rigidly flat while the legs contain the shadow forms of lathed wooden dowels.  This subtle piece started with a sculpture in clay that I reverse moulded with wax. Parchemins  evokes the lightest of memories of tables past with an underlying material strength, only possible in cast metal.

<i>Return to Form</i> is an “ornamental” frame made of sculpted heads and ornamental molding that seem to float in space around a mirror.

<br/><br/>

To make Return to Form I used an ancient Greek technique of clay and wax waste molds that distort the original sculpture in unpredictable ways. Once cast in bronze I gilded the frame with white gold leaf, which I then tarnished with chemical vapors until the lemon colored golden surface appeared. I also intervened on the mirror’s surface, developing a method to mask and sand etch the surface to make it look as if the steam from the shower has just been wiped off, revealing a human image returned to form again, every day different and yet seemingly always the same.

<p style="margin-top:0px">
As a painter and sculptor, I seek forms that are open and closed, ordered and disordered in equal measure and in which opulent workmanship competes with untouched raw materials to reveal the push and pull between the public and private, the epic and the transient. I often work with sculpted plaster that looks as if it has naturally aged and crumbled over time. It is more difficult to evoke this aesthetic with traditional bronze sculptures, but recently, I developed a technique of painting in hot wax that allows me to make expressive and delicate bronze surfaces that balance the strength of metal with the visual fragility of painted brush strokes.

<p>
  These unique surfaces and motifs are the foundation for a new series of functional sculptures, called More Material, on which I have been working for the the past 18 months at La Fonderie Fusions in Auvergne, France.
</p>

<p>
  The pieces in More Material use the domestic environment as inspiration for both their utilitarian forms and their playful intellectual content:
  <ul>
    <li>
  <i>Oceans of Notions</i>, an undulating modular coffee table made with one-of-a-kind open panels, has surfaces inscribed in an unknown language of swishes and swirls. </li>
<li>
  <i>Parchemins</i>, a side-table with thin ragged edges, is the ghostly image of a simple wooden table, the top precariously balanced on scroll like legs.
</li>
    <li>
        In <i>Return to Form</i>, a mirror that looks like the steam has been wiped away after a hot shower is framed by an ornate, decaying, almost animate golden frame that reflects on our reflection through time.
    </li>
    <li>
  <i>Les Lumieres</i> are four unique lamps that illuminate men from within, mocking our cultural preference for male luminaries.
    </li>
    <li>
<i>The Plate Throwers</i>, a dish cupboard that looks like a gestural golden painting on the outside, on the inside hides a sculptural portrayal of the endless fight we all have as to who will do the dishes next. 
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
To make More Material, the foundry has been my studio and my laboratory. David de Gourcuff, the owner of the foundry, invested in my work, put me up in his home, and gave me unprecedented access and free rein to work and play in the midst of his busy foundry. Making these pieces involved collaborations with every atelier of the foundry, and every worker there helped me at some critical juncture or other. This collection would not have been possible otherwise.

<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>
I was born to a family of artists living in the woods of New Hampshire. My siblings and I were homeschooled, that is, we were mostly left to pursue our own projects. At seventeen, I went to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where I formally studied painting and sculpture.  I then moved to Paris, where I assisted the sculptor Jean Cardot on his public monuments for two years, before moving to my own studio to work on painting, sculpture, and now, furniture.

<h3>Intimate Portraits</h3>

<p>
  Since childhood, retreating into my private world has been the generative stance in which it is possible for me to make things. Alone in my studio, the vulnerability that comes with openness can be a cultivated strength, and the space that the dust takes up in between the things in the room is as much part of what I can see and feel and use as inspiration as the things, sculptures, and living models that surround me.
</p>

<p>
To me, the model is not just a means to making a painting or sculpture but a walking, breathing conduit for the unknown. The images I make with models are fractured embroideries of time; they mix observed moments with a more inward form of seeing and feeling.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<hr/>

<h3>Plaster + Hybrids</h3>
  
<p>
  Over time I increasingly turned toward making paintings on plaster in which I experimented with admixing sculptural elements and shadow into the pieces. In some instances my hybrid plaster paintings look no different from paintings on other supports, except for their slightly irregular shapes or the texture on their cast plaster surfaces. In other works, using plaster supports allows me to integrate high and low relief into my painting by breaking, sculpting, scratching away and incising portions of the surface image.

My sister Jasmine, before Hanna, was my model for many paintings between 2006-2008. During these years she was having health problems and modeling was the only job she felt up to. Her quiet inward state inscribed itself into the images I made of her during those years.

In recent years I have had many different models that come to work with me usually over a span of several months or years. Margaux, a talented young photographer, modeled and spent time in my studio in 2014 and 2015.

The sculptures lying around my studio grew to be an ungainly population of mismatched heads and bodies which often appear in the background of my paintings.

<h3>Hot Wax and <i>More Material</i></h3>

<p>
  In 2014 I developed a technique of painting in hot wax in order to make expressive metal surfaces while making a small series of new sculptures.
  My sculpture <i>Armour</i> is an example of this new direct wax technique.
</p>

<p>
  At the beginning of 2016 I began developing these new techniques into a series of unique furniture pieces and painterly architectural motifs in bronze that embody my lifelong interest in making art that reflects on  the private experience of home and family life. I am calling this new series of domestic sculptures More Material as these are  works in which the material weight and bulk compete with their visual and conceptual presence.
