<p>
I have come to realize that most paintings and sculptures do not end up in museums but rather in private homes, where they live and change as we, their co-habitants and viewers, live and change. With “More Material” my aim is to make sculptures which are visual objects that can be thought upon or eaten upon in the sanctuaries of our homes. These new sculptures use brushstrokes, broken forms and double takes to harness bronze’s unique potential to balance strength with visual fragility. 
</p>

<p>
Over the past 18 months, I have been working at the Fusions foundry in Auvergne, France, to make More Material, a new collection of sculptures that are portraits of things---a table which is a sculptural painting on legs, a mirror which reflects on the passage of time, a lamp that illuminates a man from within, a cupboard that is on the outside a gestural golden painting and on the inside a portrayal of the endless fight we all have as to who will do the dishes next (as well as a fine place to stack the dishes or stash the booze).
</p>

<p>
The abstract liquid imagery of the bronze surfaces, often created with a variety of approaches that include hot wax painting and direct wax building, combined with fragments of sculptures from my studio, molded using an ancient Greek technique of clay and wax waste molds that distort the original sculpture in unpredictable ways, are the building blocks of these pieces.   Each piece has an element of chaos and an element of formal structure as I look for an esthetic balance between order and disorder, between visual lightness and material strength.
</p>

<p>
The patinas for the sculptures in More Material were wonderful discoveries that appeared after weeks of experimentation (I probably spent as much time researching these patinas as all the other processes combined.) See the mingled yellow to pink to red colors in the silver leaf façade of The Plate Throwers and the unusual dirty lemon yellow of the white gold leaf frame for the mirror Return to Form. To obtain these colors, I engineered a chemical vapor tent to tarnish gold and silver which allows the metal leaf to pass through a whole spectrum of colors, which I can then fix with varnish when I choose.
</p>

<p>
To make More Material the foundry has been my studio and my laboratory. David de Gourcuff, the head of the foundry, not only invested in my work, put me up in his home, but also gave me unprecedented free reign to work and play in the midst of his busy foundry. Making these pieces involved me in collaborations with every atelier of the foundry, and every worker there has helped me at some critical juncture or other.  This collection would not have been possible without the daily support of David de Gourcuff and the foundry Fusions.
