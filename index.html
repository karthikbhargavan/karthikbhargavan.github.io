Sometimes I imagine to myself that if I were a man my work would be more visible to others. This is wrong, of course, because the fact that I am free to make my work is everything, really, and to hold the belief that I can see clearly and understand the perception of others is pure fantasy. Still, such projections can begin to feel very real and dominate our daily experiences of one another, and of what we make, do and say.  <i>Les Lumières</i>  which translates in English as <i>The Luminaries</i>, is made up of four unique bronze sculptures lit from within. This work lays bare my own little fears and apprehensions about working in an art world that is still dominated by male intellectuals, artists, and collectors. To make the one-of-a-kind sculptures, I started with four studies I had made of different male models over the years, marrying the legs and torsos of the original sculptures to a variety of light filtering abstract structures built in direct wax. For the finish, I explored new ways of creating a patina with chemical vapours that resulted in this unusual blue/grey/black color and texture.

I have come to realize that most paintings and sculptures do not end up in museums but rather in private homes, where they live and change as we, their co-habitants and viewers, live and change. It is through a daily contact with art that we experience it’s real power. With <i>More Material</i> my aim is to make sculptures which are visual objects that can be thought upon or eaten upon in the sanctuaries of our homes. These new sculptures use brushstrokes, broken forms and double takes to harness bronze’s unique potential to balance strength with visual fragility.
</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/235557083?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Over the past 18 months, I have been working at the Fusions foundry in Auvergne, France, to make More Material, a new collection of sculptures that are portraits of things---a table which is a sculptural painting on legs, a mirror which reflects on the passage of time, a lamp that illuminates a man from within, a cupboard that is on the outside a gestural golden painting and on the inside a portrayal of the endless fight we all have as to who will do the dishes next (as well as a fine place to stack the dishes or stash the booze).
</p>

<p>
The abstract liquid imagery of the bronze surfaces, often created with a variety of approaches that include hot wax painting and direct wax building, combined with fragments of sculptures from my studio, molded using an ancient Greek technique of clay and wax waste molds that distort the original sculpture in unpredictable ways, are the building blocks of these pieces.   Each piece has an element of chaos and an element of formal structure as I look for an esthetic balance between order and disorder, between visual lightness and material strength.
</p>

<p>
The patinas for the sculptures in More Material were wonderful discoveries that appeared after weeks of experimentation (I probably spent as much time researching these patinas as all the other processes combined.) See the mingled yellow to pink to red colors in the silver leaf façade of The Plate Throwers and the unusual dirty lemon yellow of the white gold leaf frame for the mirror Return to Form. To obtain these colors, I engineered a chemical vapor tent to tarnish gold and silver which allows the metal leaf to pass through a whole spectrum of colors, which I can then fix with varnish when I choose.
</p>

<p>
To make More Material the foundry has been my studio and my laboratory. David de Gourcuff, the head of the foundry, not only invested in my work, put me up in his home, but also gave me unprecedented free reign to work and play in the midst of his busy foundry. Making these pieces involved me in collaborations with every atelier of the foundry, and every worker there has helped me at some critical juncture or other.  This collection would not have been possible without the daily support of David de Gourcuff and the foundry Fusions.

I was born at home in 1973 in an old house in the back woods of NH, a middle child in a large family.  My parents are artists who homeschooled us when we were little.  I never went to a conventional school; instead I took my high school equivalency test at 16 in order to go to art school in Philadelphia.

<p>
At the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts I studied painting, printmaking, sculpture, and foundry work over a span of eight years, taking long breaks for traveling, working and studying elsewhere, until graduating in 1999. 
</p>


<p style="clear:both">
A year after graduation, I came to live in Paris to be an assistant to the French sculptor Jean Cardot. I worked on several clay studies for his monument of Thomas Jefferson (Quai D’Orsay, Paris) and many of his other public commissions, working full time in his studios in Paris and at the foundry Coubertin, where I was able to further my education in bronze casting. During this time, I also worked on a weekly basis with the noted Parisian mold maker, Sebastien de Nobilé, deepening my understanding of many different mold-making techniques.
</p>

<p class="caption">Leonardo da Vinci relief, plaster, 2001</p>
</div>

<p>
Among the things I worked on as Cardot’s assistant was a relief sculpture of Leonardo da Vinci; I used da Vinci’s famous self-portrait drawing as my guide. The final bronze version of this relief (after being further worked on by Cardot) is now on da Vinci’s gravesite in Amboise, Loire Valley, France.

<p>
In 2003 I stopped working for Cardot and I moved into my own studio in Paris. To support myself, I started giving private classes from my studio and took portrait commissions in sculpture and painting.

<p>
In 2006, I started a personal project that I called <i>The Family Painting Project</i>, making portraits from life of individuals and families in their homes. In 2010, my portrait from this series, of George Whitman reading to himself in bed with his daughter Sylvia Whitman sitting by his side was shown at the National Gallery in London as part of the BP portrait award exhibition.

In the studio my painting became increasingly oriented toward working on cast plaster supports,  allowing me to mix sculptural elements and shadow to the painted image.
My sister Jasmine and other friends modeled for me in poses of sleep and rest to make these early intimate paintings.

As I began to show more, I also began to work with models on a more regular basis than I had previously been able to.

<p>
A note about working with models: The model has become for me, not just a means to making a portrait or a nude but a walking, breathing conduit of the living unknown. The images I make with models are fractured embroideries of time, they mix observed moments with a more inward form of seeing and feeling while exploring themes of imperfection, visual fragility, repetition and incompleteness.

As time went by, the sculptures lying around my studio accumulated until I was living with a veritable population of little heads and bodies–these motionless onlookers began to appear regularly in the background of my paintings.

<p>
Over the years my work naturally evolved into a hybrid form of painting and sculpture, exemplified by my oil paintings on cast plaster supports.  In some instances, these hybrid paintings look no different from paintings on other supports, except perhaps for their slightly irregular shapes or the texture on their cast plaster surfaces. In other works, using plaster supports has allowed me to integrate high and low relief into my painting by breaking, sculpting, scratching away and incising portions of the surface image.

In 2014/2015 after many years mostly devoted to working with models and painting on plaster, I began to turn toward sculpture again in order to realize a number of one of a kind pieces at the foundry Fusions as part of an exchange for a large sculpture with David de Gourcuff (the head of the foundry).

I wanted to experiment with direct building in wax and it was during this time that I started testing the limits of what would be possible to cast.  To make the base for the sculpture <i>Armour</i>, I poured a paper-thin sheet of wax onto wet plaster with only a few thicker patches.  It was possible that it would be a huge failure –the foundry could not insure that I would have a complete piece once the wax was transformed into bronze.  In the end my experiment worked as I had hoped and the emergent sculpture conveyed both a raw material force and delicacy new to my sculpture and unlike anything I had seen before.

In keeping with my lifelong interest in (obliquely) depicting my intimate experience of home and family, It came over me that I wanted to take these bronze experiments into a new realm and make sculptures that are meant to be touched and lived with and that use our domestic environments as inspiration for both their formal and intellectual content.

Thus came about “More Material”, the experimental sculptures and surfaces that you see here.
